# README

## Almēs

Welcome to Almēs, a game about following a child to adulthood (and beyond) in a fantastical world. The decisions made in-game will shape who they are and will become.

This repository is intended to serve as a personal C++ programming guide and refresher when needed.

## Installation

Download this repository by downloading the zipped file and unzipping it; alternatively, clone the repository using the command:

`git clone https://github.com/michael24peters/rpg.git`.

Then move to the directory you just created and build the program using the commands:

`cmake -B ./build`
`cmake --build ./build`

Alternatively, for `sh`, you can build and run the program using a single command:

`./tools/scripts/buildAndRun.sh`

There is currently no `cmd` (Windows compatible) version of this.

## Usage

You can use the program by running the main executable:

`./build/bin/run.exe`
