===SCENE 1===

*A bitter wind whistles in the air. A layer of snow rests on the trees and mountains filling the background. 

*Pan down to two groups of people dressed in formal attire, left and right. In the middle stands a figure with a raven's headdress and antlers.
A fire is slowly kindled on both sides. Then, a man, a woman, and a child step forward from the left; a man, a woman, and a child step forward from the right. 
The children pull the fire on each side, meeting in the middle.*

*The man from the left side calls out.* 

"Now let there be peace between us, !!-do."

"Peace... but for how long?"

"..."

Mysterious figure: "The signs be good, your flames strong. Here gather two houses prepared to swear to peace. Swear to uphold peace." 

Left: "Krom as my witness, I swear to uphold peace."

Right: "I swear to uphold peace."

Mysterious figure: "Swear by your sons."

Left: "I swear by my second son."

Right: "I swear by my third son."

Mysterious figure: "Swear by the Flame."

Left: "By Krom, I swear by the Flame."

Right: "...I swear by the Flame."

Mysterious figure: "Swear by Apep."

*The left appears outraged.*

Mysterious figure: "Swear by the serpent god, Apep. Do it."

Left: "...I...I swear by Apep."

Right: "I swear by Apep, Bringer of Life."

Mysterious figure: "Then it is done!"

*The mysterious figure looks at the two children. A bass of black, yellow serpent eyes, distortion on the world.
The camera zooms to the leftmost child, who now walks to the right, then stops, looks back, their family's face obscured by the snow.*

Mysterious figure: *Go, child.*

*The leftmost child walks to the right family, and the screen fades to black as they both leave the scene.*
