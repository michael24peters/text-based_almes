===SCENE 1===

*A bitter wind whistles in the air. A layer of snow rests on the trees and 
    mountains filling the background. 

*Pan down to two groups of people dressed in formal attire, left and right. One 
    notable exception is a scarred warrior on the right {mentor}. In the middle 
    stands a figure with a raven's headdress and antlers. A fire is slowly 
    kindled on both sides. Then, a man, a woman, and a child step forward from 
    the left; a man, a woman, and a child step forward from the right. The 
    children pull the fire on each side, meeting in the middle.*

*The man from the left side calls out.* 

"Now let there be peace between us, Ásmundar-do."

"Peace... but for how long?"

"..."

Mysterious figure: "The signs be good, your flames strong. Here gather two 
    houses prepared to swear to peace. Swear to uphold peace." 

Left: "Krom as my witness, I swear to uphold peace."

Right: "I swear to uphold peace."

Mysterious figure: "Swear by your sons."

Left: "I swear by my second son."

Right: "I swear by my third son."

Mysterious figure: "Swear by the Flame."

Left: "By Krom, I swear by the Flame."

Right: "...I swear by the Flame."

Mysterious figure: "Swear by Apep."

Left side, in unison, except for the leading three: "!!"

*A long silence ensues.*

Mysterious figure: "Swear by the serpent god, Apep. Do it."

Left: "...I...I swear by Apep."

Right: "I swear by Apep, Bringer of Life."

Mysterious figure: "Then it is done!"

*The right party exchange some words with the right party. The left side 
    noticeably stays completely quiet, ready to send their child off without so 
    much as a word of parting.*

*The mysterious figure looks at the two children. A bass of black, yellow serpent 
    eyes, distortion on the world. The camera zooms to the leftmost child, who 
    now walks to the right, then stops, looks back, their family's face obscured 
    by the snow.*

Mysterious figure: *Go, child.*

*The leftmost child walks to the right family, and the screen fades to black as 
    they both leave the scene.*

===END OF SCENE 1===

===SCENE 2===

*Camera shows child in a room alone with a garden outside, the seasons changing from one to the next.*

*Cuts to black, and they are now seen running away into the wilderness, The 
    child hides behind a tree, distant torches and movement in the distance. A 
    tear rolls down their face.*

*Fade to black.*

*Cut back to the child in that same room alone again, until the mentor walks 
    through the door.*

Mentor: "So you're the troublemaker, eh? What a miserable little pup you are."

User:
    "..."
    "Go away."
    "Who are you?"

Mentor:
    {no response}
    "Looks like you understand very little about the world. I'll just have to fix that."
    "Your master."

Mentor: "Ásmundar's orders, you're coming with me. Get your belongings."

Child: "..."

Mentor: "Got nothing? Better that way. Let's go."

===SCENE 2 v2===

*Camera shows child in a room alone with a garden outside, the seasons changing 
    from one to the next.*

*Cuts to black, and they are now seen running away into the wilderness, somewhat 
    older than before. The child hides behind a tree, distant torches and 
    movement in the distance. A tear rolls down their face.*

*Fade to black.*

*Cut back to the child in that same room alone again, until the mentor walks 
    through the door.*

Mentor: "By the looks of things, I wager this is your first visitor--excepting 
    the maids and attendants, of course."

User:
    "..."
    "So what?"
    "Go away."
    "Who are you?"

Mentor:
    "Not much of an orator, are you? (He laughs.) Words will come." {Wis progress}
    "Quite the sharp tongue. Time will tell whether it leads you to ruin."
    "Your words betray an empty life. Alas for you, for I will not."
    "A fine attempt at cordiality. In time you will learn the proper order of 
        such things." {Cha progress}

Mentor: "Asmundar-do has placed you under my ward. You will refer to me as Master. 
    Now, gather your belongings."

Child: "..."

*You have no belongings.*

Master: "(He smiles.) It is only in retrospect that you will learn what a gift 
    has been granted unto you. Many would sacrifice anything to begin their life 
    anew, with naught but the clothes on their back.
